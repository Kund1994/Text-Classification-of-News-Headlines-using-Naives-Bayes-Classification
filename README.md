## What is Naives Bayes?

Naive basyes classifier works on the priniciple of condition probability as given by the Bayes theorem. The bayes theorem gives us the conditional probability of an event **A** given that an event **B** has occured. In the Bayes theorem, the probability of **A** occuring given that **B** has occured, is the probability of **B** occuring fiven that **A** has occured times the probability of **A** over the probability of **B**.

## Naives Bayes and Machine Learning

![alt-text](

It is importnat to undertand where the Naives Bayes fits in the heirarchy of Machine Learning. So under machine learning there is **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**. Under the supervised learning there is the **Classification** and **Regression**. And under Classification we have the **Naives Bayes**.
